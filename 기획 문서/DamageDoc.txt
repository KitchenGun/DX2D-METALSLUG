 An investigation of various weapon damage in MS3, excluding those cases where one shot simultaneously hits multiple hitboxes. Given that a pistol bullet deals damage by 1. Some weapons inflict additional splash hit(s) and damage.

Knife: deals 3 per hit, each hit grants 500 points.

Heavy machine gun: deals 1 per hit, identical to the pistol.

Rocket launcher: deals 3 per hit. It also has 3 additional splash hits, inflicting 5 in total.

Flame shot: deals 13 hits and damage by 31.4 in total. When used against Monoeyes or Partner's liquid jail, it inflicts 0.5 per hit. For zombies in Mission 2, it causes 1-hit KO.

Shot gun: deals 20 per hit.

Laser gun: deals 0.8 per hit. Its minimal ammo unit is actually 0.5 rather than 1. The relationship between consumed ammo and hit counts can be explained by the formula - "hit counts = (consumed ammo / 0.5) + 2".

enemy Chaser: deals 3 per hit. It has an additional splash hit, dealing 1.

Iron lizard: similar to R, but its total splash damage is 3.

Drop shot: similar to C,  but its splash damage is 0.1.

super Grenade: deals 10 per hit, it has an additional splash hit, dealing 5.

Mobile Satellite: deals 1 per hit, identical to the pistol.

Thunder cloud: deals 3 per hit, no splash hit is found.

Grenade: deals 10 per hit. It has 2 additional splash hits, dealing 0.1, respectively.



Vulcan: deals 1 per hit, identical to Heavy machine and the pistol.

Runover(weak): deals 0.1 per hit. As far as I know, this can be done with some Slugs, including SV-Camel and Slug Flyer in MS2/X, Ostrich Slug in MS3, Bradley in MS4. Not sure if there are other examples.

Runover(strong): deals 5 per hit. This works in most Slugs.

Cannon(MS): deals 20 per hit. It has an additional splash hit, inflicting 5.

Cannon(Slugnoid): deals 20 per hit. It has 3 additional splash hits, dealing 3 in total.

Melee(LV armor): deals 3 per hit, but only 100 points are received from each hit.

Laser gun(LV armor): The formula is slightly different from the human case - "hit counts = (consumed ammo / 0.5) + 1"

Cannon(LV armor): deals 10 per hit. No splash hit is found.

Cannon(Drill Slug): deals 1 per hit. A drill cannon brings about 30 hits in total. Direct drilling on moving has the same damage rate.

Laser gun(Astro Slug):  "hit counts = (consumed ammo * 3.5) + 8"(Two side launchers intact);  "hit counts = (consumed ammo * 3.5)"(One side launcher intact). Since hit count must be an integer, the minimal ammo unit should be 2.

Missile(Astro Slug): deals 10 per hit. No splash hit is found.

Machinery Slug attack: deals 40 per hit. It has a splash hit, dealing 1.

Piercing Slug/cannon: identical to the case where cannon or Slug explodes on the enemy, but this provides multiple hits, probably 1 hit per 2 frames until the final explosion occurs, like runover.

Slug Copter's propeller: Logically, I can only say its damage per hit is 0.3 or lower, maybe 0.1. Compared with Runover, it has lower attack frequency, but each hit grants 500 points.﻿ 作者：BLazeKiller https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv4905427 出处：bilibili
